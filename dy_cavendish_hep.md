## __For__

* Prominence in adjacent fields

* Simplifying framework

## __Against__

* Tried and found wanting

## A historic debate
<style scoped>ul { padding: 0; list-style: none; }</style>

* [[1st PhyStat workshop, 2000]](https://cds.cern.ch/record/411537/files/CERN-2000-005.pdf)

  Talk of Peter Clifford (Mathematical statistician, PhD student of Neyman)

* _"Well, maybe I didn’t spell it out, but before I came here I assumed that all physicists were Bayesians. Physicists are interested in induction, they want to modify their beliefs about the true state of nature on the basis of the data that they’ve observed. When you are busy __integrating out parameters, in a sense, you keep slipping into a Bayesian mode of operating__"_

<!-- &nbsp;
A potential aside on 5$\sigma$ -->

<!-- _"If you’re in a situation with high prior sensitivity, where the data is really not telling you a whole lot, then that’s an important piece of information too"_ -->

* ### Is HEP exceptional (compared to Bayesian dominated fundamental physics fields e.g. Cosmology?) Or have we missed a trick?

----
### A historic debate - troubling reading?

Peter Clifford, cont.

_Early statisticians saw benefits in devising simple rules for testing the null hypothesis...__“time is precious – analyse the data and move on to the next client”__. The statistician’s perspective was made explicit by Neyman._
... 
_Neyman’s advice was to control the frequency of Type I error within this ensemble. __In other words, in your career as a statistician, arrange that the frequency of rejecting null hypotheses incorrectly is no more than, say, 5%.___

----
### A historic debate $-$ Hypothesis testing

A lot of ink spilled about this topic, my 2c,

* __Particle:__ Comparing $H_\mathrm{SM}$ to $H_\mathrm{SM+BSM}$ - strong prior beliefs overpower likelihoods
  * $\rightarrow$ Bayesian belief quantification perhaps not best suited

* __Cosmo:__ "Standard Model" $\Lambda_\mathrm{CDM}$ is an effective theory
  * $\rightarrow$ More analogous to SMEFT

*  In particle we are increasingly asking model comparison questions that move us towards the Cosmo side, see SMEFIT [[2105.00006]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.00006)



----
### Defining the evidence
<style scoped>ul { padding: 0; list-style: none; }</style>

* $$ \mathrm{Posterior} = \frac{\mathrm{Likelihood}\times \mathrm{Prior}}{\mathrm{Evidence}}\, $$

  $$ P(\theta | X) = \frac{\mathcal{L}(X | \theta)\times \Pi(\theta) }{Z}\, $$

  Where $Z = \int d\theta \mathcal{L}(X | \theta) \Pi(\theta)$

* Will sometimes see this as

  $$ P(\theta | X) = \frac{P(X | \theta)\times P(\theta) }{P(X)}\, $$

  definition of conditional probability

### Pillars of Bayesian inference

* ### __Model Comparison__

  $$\mathcal{Z} = \int d\Phi \mathcal{L}(\Phi) \Pi (\Phi) $$

  An "Evidence first" approach, concentrate on issues of model comparison

## Nested Sampling

Nested Sampling [[Skilling 2006]](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bayesian-analysis/volume-1/issue-4/Nested-sampling-for-general-Bayesian-computation/10.1214/06-BA127.full), implemented for in PolyChord [[1506.00171]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00171). Is a good way to generically approach this problem for $\mathcal{O}(10)\rightarrow \mathcal{O}(100)$ dimensions

__Features__
* Primarily an integral algorithm (largely unique vs other MCMC approaches)
* Designed for multimodal problems from inception 
* Requires construction that can sample under hard likelihood constraint
* Largely self tuning
  * $\rightarrow$ Little interal hyperparameterization
  * $\rightarrow$ More importantly, "tunes" any reasonable prior to posterior

*"Flow-based sampling for multimodal distributions in lattice field theory"* [[2107.00734]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00734)

<!-- $\phi^4$ scalar lagrangian with wrong sign (higgs) mass potential -->

Fit to background only diphoton data

Sample realisation of Poission noise data

![bg right:60% width:700](./assets/predict_pres.png)

### Likelihoods

$$
\mathcal{L}(n_i \lvert \Theta) = \prod_i  b(x_i,\Theta)^{n_i} \frac{e^{-b(x_i,\Theta)}}{n_i!}
$$

$$
    b(x_i,\Theta) = b(x_i,\theta,N,\phi) = \sum^N_k \phi_k(x_i,\theta)
$$

What we want $P(\theta,N,\phi \lvert n_i)$
What we get out the box with frequentist inference $P(\hat\theta \lvert n_i, N,\phi )$

How do we understand the discrete $\{N,\phi\}$?

----
### Discrete Profiling

Closest analogue, CMS method [[1408.6865]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.6865)

ATLAS, Spurious signal tests, not discussed here

Treat each choice of $\{N,\phi\}$ as a discrete model
$\rightarrow$ derive set of individual $P(\hat\theta \lvert n_i)_{\{N,\phi\}}$

## But...

Larger values of $N$ always prefered, have to derive a correction

### Pick some useful functions

<div class="columns">
<div>

$$
    \phi= \mathrm{exp}:\\   b(x,\theta, N) = \sum_{m=1}^{N_{\mathrm{max}}} \theta_{1,m} \exp (-\theta_{2,m} x)
$$
$$
    \phi= \mathrm{power}: \\  b(x,\theta, N) = \sum_{m=1}^{N_{\mathrm{max}}} \theta_{1,m}  (x+1)^{-1.5\theta_{2,m}}
$$
$$
    \phi= \mathrm{logpoly}: \\  b(x,\theta, N) = \sum_{m=1}^{N_{\mathrm{max}}} \theta_{1,m} \log(x+e)^{-4\theta_{2,m}}

$$

![width:500px center](./assets/ranges.png)

----
### Choose some priors

Basis amplitudes: ___sorted_ Uniform__, $\theta_1 \in  [-10,10]$ 
$\rightarrow$ __nb:__ Does it make sense for this to be negative*? Hard likelihood boundary in NS makes this trivial, max likelihood approach not so clear 

Basis exponent: __Uniform__, $\theta_2 \in  [0,5]$

Hierarchical params: __Uniform integer__, $N,\phi \in  (1,3)$




$\rightarrow$ assuming *, yields functions like $f(x) = e^{-x} \rightarrow$ smooth constantly decreasing
$f'(x)<0, f''(x) > 0$ $\rightarrow$ desireable inductive bias

----

### Set the heights

<center>

Frequentist: $\quad -\mathrm{AIC} = 2 \ln {\hat{\mathcal{L}}} - 2k$
Bayesian: $\quad \ln\mathcal{Z}  = \langle \ln \mathcal{L} \rangle_P - D_\mathrm{KL}$

### An optimial correction term


Kullbeck-Leibler divergence:
__Information gain between prior and posterior__

$$
D_\mathrm{KL} = \int d\theta P(\theta) \ln \frac{P(\theta)}{\Pi(\theta)}
$$

Quantifies How far apart the prior and posterior are

![bg right:50% width:500px center](./assets/dkl.png)

----

### Find the probabilities

<center>

Frequentist: $\quad \mathcal{L}(N,\phi)_{\mathrm{AIC}}=\exp \bigg( \frac{\mathrm{AIC}_{\mathrm{min}}- \mathrm{AIC}_{N,\phi}}{2} \bigg)$
Bayesian: $\quad P(N,\phi)= \frac{\mathcal{Z}_{N,\phi}}{\sum(\mathcal{Z}_{N,\phi})}$

### Signal model

Generic Gaussian signal "bumphunt"

$$
    H_\psi: \quad  \mathcal{L}(n_i \lvert \Psi,\Theta) = \prod_i \big(s(x_i,\psi) + b(x_i,\Theta)\big)^{n_i}\cdot \frac{e^{-(s(x_i,\psi) +  b(x_i,\Theta))}}{n_i!}
$$

$$
s(x_i,\psi) = s(x_i,A,\mu,\sigma) = A \cdot \mathrm{Normal}(\mu,\sigma) 

$$

Amplitude: __Uniform__ $A \in  [0,500], A_\mathrm{true}=150$
Mean: __Uniform__ $\mu \in  [100,180], \mu_\mathrm{true}=125$
Variance: __Uniform__ $\sigma \in  [0.5,3], \sigma_\mathrm{true}=1$

Narrow width generic signal search

----
### True positive - Type II errors

$$\frac{\mathcal{Z}_\psi}{\mathcal{Z}_0} = \frac{P(H_\Psi)}{P(H_0)}= 9.29 \pm 1.37 $$ 

Interpret as ~9:1 odds of $H_\Psi$ over $H_0$, roughly 90% confidence in $H_\Psi$

_Evidence is all you need_ - Directly calculate the only thing I care about, well calibrated global odds.

![bg right:50% width:400](./assets/search_result.png)

----

### Signal parameters

Recover the true (dotted lines) signal parameters

Resolve rich information about the model

* __Discrete:__ Sample over $\{N,\phi\}$

* __Fixed:__ Fix $\{N=2,\phi=\mathrm{exp}\}$

Marginalising discrete parameters greatly improves signal inference

![bg left:55% width:600](./assets/corner.png)

----
### False positive - Type I errors

Arguably more important for unsupervised learning - repeat with no signal injected

$$\frac{\mathcal{Z}_\psi}{\mathcal{Z}_0} = \frac{P(H_\Psi)}{P(H_0)}= 0.59 \pm 0.08 $$ 

Null ~ twice as likely as BSM

### ML anomaly detection 

Renewed interest in leverage ML, beyond the bump hunt [[2101.08320]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08320)

Still often bump hunting (in latent space) $\rightarrow$ excellent candidate for more shape aware (discrete marginal) fitting

A lot of approaches struggle with False positives $\rightarrow$ Bayesian amortization an excellent candidate

### Look Elsewhere Effect

Particularly sensitive to modelling in tails, e.g. dijet fit function

Less my area but can aspects of PDFs be approached with Bayesian paradigm ($\chi^2$ fits, Hessian approximations etc.)

### Fine detail of model comparison problems are (for my money) increasingly coming to the fore of particle physics

### Bayesian Inference is a natural way to construct model comparison problems

### Nested Sampling has been demonstrated as indispensible for model comparison without approximations in Cosmology
